# TeamSpark MCP Link TODO

## SDK

Turn into npm package

## Log level

Configurable with info as default, review info logging (just startup mode/config, bridge messages, shutdown)

## Startup failure logging

Expose bridge clients (config and logs)
- Do we want any more log structure?  Timestamp for each event might be nice.

Add log support for stdio container?

Test with npx/uvx container (our own)

Validate logs in test
